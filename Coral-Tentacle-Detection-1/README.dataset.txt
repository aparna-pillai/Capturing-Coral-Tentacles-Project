This Roboflow project is for our school Capstone Computer Science project. We are creating a desktop application to automatically count the tentacles on pictures of coral that the user will upload.

We are creating this project for our school's coral research program, where students currently have to manually count tentacles to assess coral health. This is a tedious process that takes hours of effort. Our application will greatly simplify this process and allow students more time for their actual research.
