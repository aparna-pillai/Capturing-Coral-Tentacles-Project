# Capturing-Coral-Tentacles-Project

**Overview**

This is our BCA ATCS senior year Capstone project. For BCA's Coral Research Program, we are creating a desktop application that uses machine learning to count how many tentacles are in a photo of coral. Users will be able to upload their own images, receive a count, and save the labeled images & counts to a database for future reference.
