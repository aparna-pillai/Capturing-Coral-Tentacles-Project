# Capturing-Coral-Tentacles-Project

**NOTE: NO LONGER IN USE**

Due to a Github storage issue with large files, we've moved everything to a new repository: 
https://github.com/aditi-dam/Capturing-Coral-Tentacles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
This is our BCA ATCS senior year Capstone project. For BCA's Coral Research Program, we are creating a desktop application that uses machine learning to count how many tentacles are in a photo of coral. Users will be able to upload their own images, receive a count, and save the labeled images & counts to a database for future reference.

If you are working with this repository, make sure to read `Instructions.txt` to have everything you need.
